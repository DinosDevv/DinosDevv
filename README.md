- 👋 Hi, I’m @DinosDevv
- 👀 I’m interested in coding (and working out which is completely irrelevant to github lmao)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning nodejs, vanilla js, css/html etc.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate (i am not in fact) but I'm building a fitness tracker app
- 📫 How to reach me perhaps guccispaghetti.bs@gmail.com ??
